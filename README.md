# Emoloyee_Attiration

#Problem Statement 
Here, we have raw dataset on HR employee Attrition in CSV format and we need to perform on some client requirements as given down below.
Let us firstly go through the dataset and analyse what exactly we have in it in order to gain better understanding of data structure: -



Task List
·        Number of employees by Department and Gender-----
·        Total employees doing Over Time (Yes/No)---
·        Total % of Male and total % of Female (use measure to calculate and then display the value in percentage) -----
·        Give the job review with the help of job satisfaction (1 and 2 being BAD else GOOD)
·        Employees by Business Travel
·        Count of Marital Status using 3 categories
·        Number of employees left
